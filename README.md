# Gender and Age Prediction

## About the Dataset

The UTKFace dataset is an extensive collection of facial images covering a broad age range from 0 to 116 years. This dataset contains over 20,000 images annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity details. The images exhibit diverse characteristics such as varied poses, facial expressions, lighting conditions, occlusions, and resolutions. It serves as a valuable resource for tasks like face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, and facial landmark localization.

## Project Objective

This project aims to predict gender and age using facial images. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model classifies the images to identify the gender (M or F) and estimate the age.
